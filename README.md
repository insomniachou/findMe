# This is a small game I wrote for my purposal. 
# The goal is to find different cube in matrix as many as possible.
# In the end you will get a reward link, which will take you to my purposal video on YouTube.

# The logic in this game is wrote in JavaScript, no thrid party library is needed.

# To start the game, download all files except readme.md, and open the html file in your browser. 
# To have the best experience, open it in mobile or devices with small screen.
# I used to use online editor tools like Plunker to host it, then open provided link in my mobile phone

# Have fun!
